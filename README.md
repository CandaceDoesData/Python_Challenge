It is your responsibility to include a note in the README section of your repo specifying code source and its location within your repo. This applies if you have worked with a peer on an assignment, used code in which you did not author or create sourced from a forum such as Stack Overflow, or you received code outside curriculum content from support staff such as an Instructor, TA, Tutor, or Learning Assistant. This will provide visibility to grading staff of your circumstance in order to avoid flagging your work as plagiarized.


PyBank:
    1. Online help with how to add the dates to the greatest increase and decrease.
        This starts on line 35 with the creation of a dates list to be used later
    
    2. In class and online help with how to calculate the current month - previous month.
    
    3. I kept getting the wrong sum for my change_list and it was driving me crazy. I got help online with how to fix that and figured out that I had to set the first change to 0.
    
    4. I found online that I could use the sum() function for a list
    
    5. I also found the max and min functions online to make that whole thing easier.
    
    6. The whole dates thing gave me a lot of trouble and I used a lot of different sources to find a solution. When I found the right resource it all seemed so much more simple than I thought it was in the beginnning!
    
    7. Getting the file to go to a specific folder gave me a lot of trouble so I found some resources online to help with that. 
    
    8. I also had to figure out how to make a new line when writing to a text file


PyPoll:
    1. I probably could have done this without so many lists, but I'm beginning to like lists a lot. 
    
    2. I didn't know how to get the unique names without duplicates from the candidate list so I checked Stack Overflow and learned about the set() function. I'm not entirely sure that I'm using it right, but the code works with no errors so I'm not going to question it!
    
    3. Using y and z to calculate amounts and percentages was a new concept to me. I tried it and I got the correct answer so I'm just going with it. I also found these resources online. 
    
    4. The round function I also found through a few different sources online. 
    
    5. I used code from the PyBank challenge to help find the winner.
    
    6. I had help from Stack Overflow with how to print the individual names from the unique candidate list.
